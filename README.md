I'm not adding commits regularly because at my workplace, we primarily use Bitbucket for version control and collaboration. Additionally, my personal projects are currently private, which is why my public contributions might seem limited. If you want to see my recent projects, contact me by e-mail, linkedIn or whatsapp and I can share them with you.
